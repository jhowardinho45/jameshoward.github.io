									<p>Hey! My name is James Howard. By the time you’re reading this I’ll have recently finished my final year at Dublin City University, as a Bachelor of Business Studies specialising in Data Analytics. I am a 22 year old from County Clare in Ireland.</p>
									<p>Throughout my college journey, I’ve been lucky enough to have learned about many aspects of business - from marketing, economics, finance, organisational psychology and the subject I decided to specialise in Data Analytics. I chose data analytics because I feel it is the future of business. Data is the most important tool now for companies, as it can help them identify trends and opportunities, assess risk and be an integral piece in decision-making. I was even lucky enough to take part in the Erasmus exchange programme at Faculdade de Economia da Universidade do Porto in my third year. I may have butchered a lot of the Portuguese language, but it also allowed me to experience a new culture and make lifelong friends and memories.</p>
									<p>I have worked at AXA Partners in an invoicing role for the last two Summers and plan to go back this Summer. In my role, I get a chance to work with datasets and different systems in order to create spreadsheets and assess data before issuing invoices and credit notes to companies and banks all around the world. In the future, I’d like to use my knowledge of data analytics to help bring success and growth to a company.</p>
									<p>Outside of my love for travelling, I enjoy hiking, watching movies, football, photography and video games. Interestingly, I first realised the power of data analysis when I watched the film Moneyball when I was 11 or 12, when one of the worst teams with one of the lowest budgets in the MLB, the Oakland Athletics, decided to implement data-analytics into their scouting strategy, going for undervalued players to create a competitive team. They revolutionised traditional scouting in baseball, and we see this approach used now in many different sports.</p>
